# ICV-Decision-Optimization-with-Pedestrian-Aggresiveness-Estimation
The Graduate Project of WYN's undergraduate program at THU, SVM. Supported by THICV

This project aims to combine the estimation of pedestrian aggresiveness into decision making progress of ego ICV. The target is to react differently according to various situation, so as to higher traffic efficiency.
